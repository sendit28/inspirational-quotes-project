# inspirational-quotes-project

Inspirational Quotes is a single page application that provides inspirational quotes and a space for a gratitude exercise.

## How To Use
Click on button to reveal your inspirational quote.

"Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins."

List three things you are grateful for.

## Installation

Clone this repository by using git@github.com:sendit28/inspirational-quotes-project.git

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sendit28/inspirational-quotes-project.git
```

## Usage

The vision for this project was creating a space for inspirational quotes.  Each time a click is pressed, a new inspirational quote is generated and appears on the page.  Below that is a "Gratitude Check-In".  Here you can input three things you are grateful for.  In the future, upon completion of the three grateful items, an affirmation quote paired with an inspirational photo will generate onto the page.  This page is a self-care practice.
